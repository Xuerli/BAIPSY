              <h3>Student workshop: Bridging AI and Psychology</h3>
              <p>The student workshop on Bridging AI with Psychology (BAIPsy) aims to facilitate the fruitful interaction between AI with Psychology.
                  AI techniques have been witnessed to be powerful and have huge potential to assist Psychological research and
                      support social care about mental health. Thus, BAIPsy seeks the applications of AI to address fundamental psychological topics.
                  By boosting discussions and exchanges between researchers from these two fields, BAIPsy provides opportunities to investigate how both fields
                  can contribute to developing next-generation AI-supported Psychology.</p>

                  <p>BAIPsy will be held in June 2024 at the School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh.
                      The workshop is designed to provide a platform for students engaged in AI and
                   Psychology research to prepsent their current projects,
                      build connections and explore potential collaborative ventures among each other.
