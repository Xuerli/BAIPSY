              <h3>Student workshop: Bridging AI and Psychology</h3>
              <p>The student workshop on Bridging AI with Psychology (BAIPsy) aims to facilitate the fruitful interaction between AI with Psychology.
                  AI techniques have been witnessed to be powerful and have huge potential to assist Psychological research and
                      support social care about mental health. Thus, BAIPsy seeks the applications of AI to address fundamental psychological topics.
                  By boosting discussions and exchanges between researchers from these two fields, BAIPsy provides opportunities to investigate how both fields
                  can contribute to developing next-generation AI-supported Psychology.</p>
              <h3> Benefits</h3>
                  <p>BAIPsy workshop is designed to provide a platform for students engaged in AI and
                   Psychology research to prepsent their current projects,
                      build connections and explore potential collaborative ventures among each other.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exploration of potential collaborative opportunities. </li>

                         <li>Networking opportunities with peers from similar and different research fields. </li>
                        <li>Broadened horizons by learning about contemporary research in AI and Psychology. </li>
                        <li>Skill enhancement through the experience of poster presentations. </li>
                        <li>The chance to win £50 or £20 (Two first-place winners in either Psychology or AI will receive £50 each; four second-place winners in either field will receive £20 each).</li>
